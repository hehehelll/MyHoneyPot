TODO for new versions:
+ Use new version of QGoogleVisualAPI and generate more graphs (eg GeoMap instead of IntensityMap?)
+ 2nd tab on Intensity Map (or new map) with successes per country (temporary SQL table/query)
+ Add option to show results only from a particular sensor (add value in config.php and then change the SQL queries? Perhaps move all SQL query strings in seperate file)
+ Option to use local/offline geolocation service and not geoplugin, see: https://www.maxmind.com/app/support
+ Proxy detection resurrection, here are some lists: https://github.com/lfamorim/barrelroll/tree/master/full_list
+ Table with returning attackers (Kippo-Input). If username/password in auth table exists in userdb.txt then he logged in again (apart from the defaults).
+ Integrate or offer as seperate utility the VirusTotal uploader by @0xAli (contact him again for file)
+ Use convert/save as ZIP file API from online-convert.com in Kippo-Input for downloaded files
+ Kippo-Input: downloaded files with curl (curl -O <file>)
+ Add the dig/host/geoip information from Kippo-Playlog to Kippo-IP as well

DONE:
+ Add www.ip-adress.com/whois/<IP> in Kippo-Geo for IPs (limit of 50 lookups per day is OK)
+ Consider replacing NoVirusThanks with http://www.garyshood.com/virus/ and http://scanthis.net/
+ Integrate Kippo-Playlog
+ Seperate HTML and PHP where possible, tidy up code!
+ Add CSV dump/backup function
+ Graphs (.png) creation should be moved to xxx-generator for each component (or all in one!)
+ Move project to sf.net/googlecode.com/github.com (next milestone version)
+ Show basic stats like number of attacks, number of IPs, total commands, etc --OK--
+ Fix XSS in Kippo-Input --OK--
+ Human activity per week, Successes per day (line), Probing busiest days (Top 20), naming conventions/changes, update gallery. --OK--
+ URGENT: Fix "Successful logins from same IP", "Probes per day", "Successes per day", when the DB is very big. See: http://t.co/TltEfH89 --OK--
+ Successes per week graph, so gallery will look complete :P --OK--
+ Add timestamp to command tables --OK--
+ New table for passwd and various commands --OK--
+ Generate and post CHECKSUMS for the tar archive online --OK--
+ Include a license file. libchart is GPL, QGoogleVisualAPI is BSD 2-Clause (aka Modified BSD aka FreeBSD), 
	geoplugin is free asks for recognition - OK,
	web template has its own license that requires link at the bottom - OK, 
	honeycomb image in the logo requires attribution - OK, 
	so Kippo-Graph license => GPL, mentioning all the others seperately, 
	see: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/75464/43511
+ Make version checking more secure with a directive in config.php (UPDATE CHECK YES/NO) --OK--
+ Check IPs for proxies or not --NO FREE/EASY SOLUTION, ABANDON--
+ Visualize IP geolocation data --OK--
+ Temporary SQL table needed for IntensityMap --OK--
+ Create a proper image for index.php --OK--
+ Visualize or display wget commands --OK--
+ Visualize or display apt-get install commands --OK--
+ Better way to visualize input/commands => Simple text/table display --OK--
+ More libchart graphs (Pies, etc) where suited --OK--
